Comments to CRAN maintainers:

Submission on August 3 had outdated docs in the commit. Looks like it triggered this message:

New submission

  Package was archived on CRAN

  Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
    URL: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs
      From: man/drop_auth.Rd
      Status: 404
      Message: Not Found

This is fixed in the latest update.

Package was archived because of assertive.reflection. Uwe Ligges wrote today saying that assertive is back and that we should bump version to get this back on CRAN. We are doing that in this version. We will remove assertive in the next CRAN update.
